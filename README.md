## Requirements

Building the API client library requires:
1. Java 1.7+
2. Maven/Gradle

## Installation

To install the API client library to your local Maven repository, simply execute:

```shell
mvn clean install
```

To deploy it to a remote Maven repository instead, configure the settings of the repository and execute:

```shell
mvn clean deploy
```

Refer to the [OSSRH Guide](http://central.sonatype.org/pages/ossrh-guide.html) for more information.

At first generate the JAR by executing:

```shell
mvn clean package
```

This will create three separate jars for test, generated sources and the main jar.
You can run these jars directly by running the below command

```java
java jar target/<--enter jar name-->
```
